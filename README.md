# Ear-Segmentation-Using-U-Net
This project was developed as part of my research internship, focusing on semantic segmentation using deep learning. It implements a U-Net model with a ResNet-34 encoder to perform pixel-wise ear segmentation on the AWEForSegmentation dataset, achieving strong IoU and Dice scores.
